/*
Find Largest Triple-Digit Number

Write a function LargestTriple that takes an integer num as input and finds the largest three-digit number that can be formed by any three consecutive digits within num. For example, if num is 123456, the function should return 456 because 456 is the largest three-digit number that appears in the integer. The input will always have at least three digits.
